<p>This project identifies the phenomenon of hard waste collection in wyndams suburbs</p>

<p>The abrupt change in the number of collection from 2009 to 2010 makes us to think the data has been started to collect since 2009</p>

<p>This analysis throws a lot of open questions on what triggers the hardwaste collection in these suburbs and also shows where population is concentrated.</p>

<p>For eg. Tarneit, point cook and truganina are relatively new suburbs when compared with weribee south but there is a significant hard waste collection happening in these suburbs which can be directly related to a strong population and economic growth in these suburbs. </p>

<p>This could also be because lot of people moving in and out of these suburbs or the community's economic affordability in these suburbs might be getting high.</p>

<p>Since these insights trigger a variety of open ended questions, this could greatly help wyndham council while planning developmental activities for its suburbs and deciding on where its resources should be concentrated.</p>
